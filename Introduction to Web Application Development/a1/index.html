                <h3> An Early History</h3>
                    <p>
                        The term "rock 'n' roll" is attributed to being coined by Alan Freed, a disk jockey from Cleveland.
                        He used it to describe some of the more upbeat R&B records he played on his radio show.
                        "Rock 'n' roll" had already been coined as a euphemism for sex, but this was the first time it
                        was used for music.

                        The musical origins of rock lie in African-American genres, mainly the blues. The first extremely
                        popular rock performer was Elvis Presley, whose career began in the 1950s. Elvis opened the door
                        for other artists such as Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly. Rock really exploded in the 1960s with
                        the rise of British rock with icons such as The Rolling Stones, The Who, and of course
                        The Beatles, the most popular rock band of all time. From this point onward, rock music has been
                        a staple of music around the world.

                <h3>Popularity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rock 'n' roll is one of the most popular music genres of all time. In fact, rock can be
                        considered the pop music of the 60s and much of the 70s. It is also one of, if not the, best
                        selling. As evidence, the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) keeps a list of the
                        best selling albums (in the US):

                        There are 100 albums on the list and most of them are also rock albums.
