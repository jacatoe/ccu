                <h3>What Is A Sub-Genre?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most genres of music have what are called sub-genres. A sub-genre belonge to its core genre of
                        music, but deviates in a unique way. For instance, the Blues genre has sub-genres such as
                        rhythm and blues(R&B), Chicago blues, jazz blues, and so on. In rock music there is a seemingly
                        endless number of sub-genres, but they are easy to narrow down to the most popular. A unique
                        genre in rock is metal; technically metal is a sub-genre of rock, but the amount of bands put
                        under that category is so large that it has become its own genre. Genre in any sort of medium
                        is largely pointless, but it does help to identify the many styles of playing music that artists
                        create.

                <h3>Popular Rock Sub-Genres</h3>
                    <p id="indent">
                        <b>Alternative:</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Alternative rock is "alternative" to the typical rock songs you might hear on the radio.
                        This became very popular in the 1990s and is characterized by bands such as Radiohead,
                        Coldplay, Matchbox Twenty, The Strokes, and The Smashing Pumpkins.
                        <br>

                        <b>Classic Rock:</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Classic rock is a very wide-reaching genre. It typically consists of rock music from the 60s,
                        70s, and 80s, and is called "classic" because this music has endured for so long. Popular classic
                        rock bands include: The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin, Boston, and Aerosmith.

                        <b>Grunge:</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Grunge kicked off in Seattle, Washington in the early 1990s. It is mainly characterized
                        by vocals that are somewhat hard to understand, and lyrics that deal with angsty issues.
                        Bands associated with grunge are Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, and Stone
                        Temple Pilots.

                        <b>Metal/Heavy Metal:</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        As stated previously, metal/heavy metal is a genre in itself. It became very prominent in the
                        1980s. Metal is associated with very loud aggressive music and lyrics dealing with anything
                        from controversial social issues to fantasy. Popular metal bands include: Metallica, Iron Maiden,
                        Black Sabbath, System of a Down, Slayer, Anthrax, and Disturbed.

                        <b>Progressive:</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Progressive rock is unique in that it typically involves longer, more complex musical
                        compositions that use many unique sounds and techniques. It also has a branch in the metal
                        genre (Progressive Metal), which follows the same ideas. Progressive bands include: Pink Floyd,
                        early Genesis, Rush, King Crimson, Dream Theater, and Tool.

                        <b>Punk:</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Punk rock is very recognizable as it is characterized by much shorter songs with a very fast
                        pace, only a few guitar chords, and commonly controversial lyrical content. Punk bands include:
                        Sex Pistols, Misfits, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag, and the Ramones.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Southern:</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Southern rock is exactly what it sounds like: rock music with a Southern twist. Lyrics usually
                        deal with the lifestyle, traditions, and issues associated with the Southeastern United States.
                        Southern rock bands include: Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers, Molly Hatchet, and early
                        Eagles.
